<h2>Biography</h2>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p><strong>Valentine</strong></p>
<p>Valentine has been Eren's closest friend since his childhood. They first met in elementary when Valentine stood up for Eren against Bullies. They've remained good friends until graduation when Eren mysteriously "disappeared". Valentine however did not notice his disappearance as she was too busy with work to become a Detective. During his disappearance, he's wondered about Val and if she even knows he's gone (Which she didn't). 5 years after his disappearance (and eventual reappearance), Eren finally reunites with Val after a mishap with mail and they're both shocked and joyed to see each other with both sides oblivious to what really happened. (More to come soon)</p>
