<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>His parents died at a young age and was put under the care of another trusted werewolf who raised Eren. She taught him the ability to speak to and understand animals. It is unknown what happened to her after the first few years. Maybe try asking Eren about it sometime</p>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p><strong>Valentine</strong></p>
<p>Valentine has been Eren's closest friend since his childhood. They first met in elementary when Valentine stood up for Eren against Bullies. They've remained good friends until graduation when Eren mysteriously "disappeared". Valentine however did not notice his disappearance as she was too busy with work to become a Detective. During his disappearance, he's wondered about Val and if she even knows he's gone (Which she didn't). 5 years after his disappearance (and eventual reappearance), Eren finally reunites with Val after a mishap with mail and they're both shocked and joyed to see each other with both sides oblivious to what really happened. (More to come soon)</p>

<p><strong>Sugar</strong></p>
<p>Sugar is Eren's current adoptive sibling. She's the one who rescued him from his "disappearance" and they now own the Pizzeria together. Out of the two, she is the more easygoing and is thus the one who talks more and represents the Pizzeria as owner. They are shown to both care and support one another despire the trials faced. Eren is the more serious one and usually "handles" the business part on the side.</p>

<p><strong>Landon</strong></p>
<p>Landon just kinda hates Eren for some reason. Maybe it's cause people like him more because he's "nice". Who knows. Eren just kinda shrugs it off though.</p>

<p><strong>Luna</strong></p>
<p>Luna is an unknown character mentioned by Eren. Supposedly Eren and Val's other close childhood friend in High School. Lost contact.</p>

<p><strong>Ally</strong></p>
<p>Ally is technically Eren's adoptive daughter after he agreed to take her in although Alyssa is the one who takes care of her mostly.</p>

<p><strong>Alyssa</strong></p>
<p>Alyssa was the first "subject" to be taken in to live with the others. Was confused at first but eventually learns to live with it since she doesn't have much to do after her failed acting career. Indicated to may like Eren but might just be stockholm syndrome so subverted.</p>

<p><strong>Grace</strong></p>
<p>Grace was taken in by Eren after she got disowned by her parents (albeit eren was the initial cause) but Grace is fine with it after knowing since she believes that her parents didnt really care for her in the first place. During her subject time, Eren acted as the main cause but also helped and comforted her under his wolf alias of "Wolfy"</p>

<p><strong>Jay</strong></p>
<p>Jay is annoying and usually harasses the girls much to Eren's annoyance who tries to keep the peace among everybody. Especially once he targets Val is when things get personal.</p>
