<h1>Overview</h1>    
<p>Replay is the town where everybody lives. It's inhabitants consist of a mix between Mystics and Humans who relatively gets along with each other. Although Humans making up more than half the population, mystics share a mutual respect and look out for each other like a mini community. (With the exception of Nicholas) The official design has undergone many changes and we don't talk about that. We only care about the original version but unfortunately we have no picture of that.</p>
